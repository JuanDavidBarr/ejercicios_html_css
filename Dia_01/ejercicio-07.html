    <h1>My name is Juan David Barrera Pati√±o</h1>
    <h2>My favorite hobby is working out</h2>
    <h3>My favorite food is hamburguer</h3>
    <p id="Why_coding">I've always been keen on computers in general. That hobby started many years ago when I used to use programs like Encarta and games like
        World of warcraf and Dofus. When I finished highschool I didn't really know what to study, for that reason, I dropped out from the first
        degree I chose, and the one I actually finished, didn't quite fulfill my expectations. I decided that I needed something new, and given that
        I had already started one bootcamp (unfortunately I couldn't finish it) which I really enjoyed, I wanted to give programming a shot. So far, 
        It's been really nice.
