            <p id="Why_coding">I've always been keen on computers in general. That hobby started many years ago when I used to use programs like Encarta and games like
                World of warcraf and Dofus. When I finished highschool I didn't really know what to study, for that reason, I dropped out from the first
                degree I chose, and the one I actually finished, didn't quite fulfill my expectations. I decided that I needed something new, and given that
                I had already started one bootcamp (unfortunately I couldn't finish it) which I really enjoyed, I wanted to give programming a shot. So far, 
                It's been really nice.

                <p>
                    One of my favorites movies and tv shows series genre is the ones about <strong>gansters</strong>. <br>
                    The sopranos is one of the most iconics mob series, I'm currently enjoying it and
                    I can say it's one of the best shows I've seen ever. <br> What I find interesting about 
                    <q>the mafia</q> is the <strong>ritualistic</strong> aspect of their costums (at least, that is the way
                    Hollywood has always portrait them in movies like <cite>The Godfather</cite>). <br> I definitely 
                    recommend it

                <h2>Lord of the rings</h2>
                <p>
                    The lord of the rings movies are, in my opinion, a master piece; its soundtrack for instance, <br>
                    makes the viewer feel like he is actually in those fantastic places of the middle earth. <br>
                    The following audio is a fragment of the arrival of the fellowship of the ring to Lothlorien <br>
                    Home of the elves.

                <h2>Famous quotes</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    Deserves it! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. 
                    And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement. 
                    For even the very wise cannot see all ends.
